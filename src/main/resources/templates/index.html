				<p>The overall purpose of this project was to gain a better
					understanding of the different stakeholders’ perspectives on
					environmental policy and the overall challenges facing the
					Chesapeake Bay and the subsequent management and policies moving
					forward.</p>
				<p>When considering the state of the Chesapeake Bay and its
					overall health over time, it is important to consider the multiple
					effects, influences, ideas, and perspectives that different
					stakeholders within the region may have towards the Bay. Although
					there has been progress in restoring and protecting the Bay, there
					is still evidence of man-induced problems such as pollution and
					overharvesting. In addition to the environmental issues facing the
					Bay region, there are many different ideas and proposed solutions
					to amend the problems.</p>
				<p>Adding to the conundrum of what should be done to restore the
					Bay, political divisions slow down the process and hinder results
					towards a cleaner and safer Bay. There are also deep divisions
					among the different stakeholders about the imbalance between
					putting an influence on protecting the Bay or protecting the
					economic livelihood of the different stakeholders in the region.
					Farmers may contribute nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment pollution
					by what actions they take on their land. Watermen may overharvest
					key species such as oysters that help contribute to the health of
					the Bay. In contrast, as scientists provide and collect data,
					policy advocates may push policy makers to enforce more
					regulations, which can often hurt different stakeholders in the
					process. Hopefully, hearing and incorporating the views and
					perspectives of all stakeholders will increase the chance of
					restoration and survival of our Chesapeake Bay.</p>

				<h2 class="major">Background Information</h2>
				<span class="image main"><img src="images/BayDrain2.jpg"
					alt="" /></span>
				<p>The Chesapeake Bay is the largest estuary in North America.
					With a watershed spanning 64,000 miles from Norfolk, VA to
					Cooperstown, NY, across six states, the bay faces many challenges
					both political and environmental.</p>
				<p>The bay was once a thriving environment for not only the
					oysters, crabs and many other species living in its waters but also
					for the watermen who harvest its resources. Once harvesting tens of
					millions bushels of oysters now down to about 1% of that, and
					providing 500 million pounds of seafood annually to the United
					States.</p>
				<p>In recent years the health of the bay has been an ongoing
					debate between the people deemed experts like policy makers or
					scholars and the people who work the land/water like farmers or
					watermen. With declining oyster and crab populations, everyone can
					agree that there is something wrong with the bay and if progress is
					not made, this national treasure may be loss forever.</p>
				<p>There have been policies put in place in order to regulate
					Bay health, although they each have varying degrees of
					effectiveness. One of the biggest pieces of legislation would be
					the 2009 Chesapeake Bay Executive Order that was signed by
					President Obama where the Bay was given the label of a national
					treasure. In doing this, the government at all levels were
					incentivized to renew and restore Bay health. This was carried out
					by an appointed committee, which was tasked with: create innovating
					solutions to Bay health, target resources to better protect the
					tributaries of the Bay, create a better plan for protecting against
					excess sediment and nutrients brought in by storm waters, and
					expand environmental research such as climate change.</p>
				<p>There are also other policies that work in tangent with the
					executive order, such as the Clean Water Act. First introduced in
					1948 as the Federal Water Pollution and Control Act, the
					legislation had seen a couple of revisions, which eventually became
					the Water Quality Control Act of 1977. The main goal is to ensure
					the quality of the water was both “swimmabe and fishable.” This is
					done through stricter enforcements, such as heavy fines for
					pollution, restrictions on dredging, and state compliance to meet
					the water quality standard set forth by TMDL’s (Total Maximum Daily
					Loads), which are the maximum amount of nutrients and pollutants
					each state/district in the watershed is allowed to let run off into
					the Bay and its rivers.</p>

			<article id="interview1">
				<h2 class="major">Scientist/Policy Advocate</h2>
				<span class="image main"><img src="images/BayDrain1.jpg"
					alt="" /></span>
				<h3>What are your biggest concerns when it comes to saving the
					Bay? How is it affecting your daily life?</h3>
				<p>My biggest concern is that saving the bay is a generational
					commitment which means you can’t just appropriate money for a few
					years or stay strong on a policy for one election cycle. It will
					take sustained commitment not just to meet the clean-up goals by
					2025, but to stay below the pollution cap once it is reached
					forever. That means every bit of population growth, development or
					infrastructure needs to offset any increases in nitrogen and
					phosphorus pollution, as well as begin to reverse trends in toxic
					contamination. The way this reality effects my daily life is in the
					way I advocate for pollution control policies for CBF. I can never
					look at the remarkable progress made in pollution reduction in the
					bay since 2010 and be satisfied that it is good enough because
					those reductions came from hard-fought policies put into place as
					much as a decade before. The science I’m evaluating and the
					policies CBF is advocating are what will be needed to stay below
					the pollution cap in 2025 and beyond. I’m essentially creating a
					legacy.</p>
				<h3>When considering new legislation, what factors do you
					consider or believe should be considered before pushing forward?</h3>
				<p>First of all, don’t fix what ain’t broke. Many advances in
					pollution reduction, habitat restoration or species recovery can be
					accomplished through good governance and existing laws. That means
					we can use the pressure of our comment letters, constituent
					engagement with members and their elected officials and judicious
					use of the press to push for funding and enforcement support of our
					existing laws. If the agencies responsible for such governance are
					recalcitrant, then we may sponsor legislation that “clarifies” the
					role of the agency. Often just the threat to do so brings the
					agency in line because they want to maintain control over their
					mandates and resources. Much of our consideration of legislation is
					to defend against bad bills brought by special interests that
					enrich their businesses at the expense of the bay. In any given
					legislative session, that is probably two thirds of our work.
					Passing legislation is very difficult, so we also work with other
					environmental groups to decide on a few priority bills that we will
					work on together. This is hard because the bills chosen by the
					group may not necessarily be a priority for CBF, but we will
					appreciate their help when it’s our turn.</p>
				<h3>When does scientific data related to Bay health and
					environmental protection take precedence over people's economic
					livelihood when making or advocating for policy decisions?</h3>
				<p>It’s an important ingredient, but I don’t fool myself into
					thinking that the scientific argument wins the battle. My job is to
					paint a picture given the scientific realities of the
					implementation of an existing or proposed policy in context with
					how the bay works. For example, a fairly new policy that targets
					phosphorus saturation in agricultural soils over-fertilized by
					chicken manure is being phased in over a 5 year period. The
					phosphorus has been washing into the bay for decades and will get
					worse if this policy isn’t put into place. One of my staff is an
					agricultural economist. We consider the economic impact of this new
					policy and agreed to the 5-year phase in as a strategy to address
					the cost for farmers to switch practices as well as allow time for
					new technologies of manure treatment and transport to come online.
					The industry continues to call for a delay in the implementation,
					so I will continue to evaluate the risk of continued phosphorus
					delivery to the clean up effort and continue to make my case. This
					example is nuanced and the way it works most of the time.
					Occasionally, the scientific data describe a smoking gun, where an
					immediate change in policy is necessary. I think we are there with
					climate change and rather than considering new policies as an
					economic burden, I consider them an opportunity to shift the
					economy in a different direction. There will always be winners and
					losers, but there are reasons why you don’t see blacksmiths and
					typewriter repairmen any more.</p>
				<h3>At this point, do you believe the 2025 targets are
					achievable for the TMDL, and in what way do you think we could
					improve reaching the 2025 target?</h3>
				<p>They are achievable in Maryland based on the seriousness this
					state made to the clean-up effort years ago and the flexibility we
					have built in to our policies and funding mechanisms. Virginia is
					close too, but Pennsylvania is far behind in reaching the targets.
					Thankfully, the bay is responding well to the pollution reductions
					we’ve already achieved and most of the bay will likely meet water
					quality standards by 2025 or shortly thereafter even given the
					slower watershed-wide progress. To improve reaching the target, all
					jurisdictions need to employ targeting tools like Geographic
					Information Systems and our knowledge of the cost-effectiveness of
					certain practices like tree planting in riparian buffers to
					optimize the dollars spent. We also need to develop robust nutrient
					trading programs that will allow a system of offsets for new growth
					as mentioned in the first question.</p>
				<h3>What challenges do you believe hinder the results of Bay
					restoration efforts the most?</h3>
				<p>Our climate is already highly destabilized. The torrential
					rains we had in 2018 delivered several years’ worth of nitrogen and
					phosphorus loads to the bay, which may set back our progress, just
					as seagrasses have reached a 30 year high and the dead zone had
					been the smallest in a decade. The full clean-up must be
					accomplished to give the bay a measure of resiliency to these kinds
					of events. Urban stormwater loads continue to go up despite
					millions of dollars being spent on urban runoff practices. Nutrient
					trading could help, but society needs to get real with how much
					individual space we need to live as the population of the region
					continues to grow.</p>
				<h3>Are there any policies, regulations, or changes you see to
					be the most necessary for Chesapeake Bay cleanup?</h3>
				<p>All 3 states need to do a better of job of forest retention
					and replanting, whether in agricultural landscapes or urban areas.
					Nothing reduces runoff and nutrient loading throughout the
					watershed better than mature forests. Second to that, we need to
					rebuild the oyster reef ecosystems in the bay. In addition to water
					filtration, reefs calm nearshore waters reducing the resuspension
					of fine sediments. Both of these ecosystem processes increase the
					available area for bay grasses and shoreline marshes that will
					address sea level rise. The increased amount of oyster shell can
					help buffer the bay’s waters against ocean acidification and reefs
					support up to 300 other species in the bay’s food web.</p>
				<h3>What is your understanding of the progress of the bay? Do
					you think it is improving, declining or staying the same?</h3>
				<p>This is where the science has been most clear and personally
					exciting for me. The bay clean-up progress is tracked through the
					Chesapeake Bay Model, which tracks changes in land use and the
					implementation of best management practices to simulate load
					reductions in nitrogen and phosphorus. According to the model, even
					with population growth, we have reduced the nitrogen load by 10s of
					millions of pounds since 1983, the year I graduated from High
					School. In the complex chemistry of how nutrients drive
					phytoplankton blooms and dissolved oxygen, the load reductions must
					reach a certain threshold before the bay’s ecology changes. We are
					beginning to see certain water quality and living resources
					thresholds become visible in the bay, if even for brief periods of
					the year. This is our indicator that the bay clean up is working
					and that going through the process to get to 2025 loads should
					actually allow us to meet water quality standards for the first
					time in my life. So, had you asked me that question when I first
					started working at CBF in 2013, I would have been forced to say
					that the bay had stayed the same for 30 years despite all of the
					nutrient load reduction efforts. But in the last 3 years,
					everything has changed and I have a lot of hope for the future if
					we continue the hard work we started.</p>

				<h2 class="major">Farmer</h2>
				<span class="image main"><img src="images/BayCow.jpg" alt="" /></span>
				<h3>What are your biggest concerns when it comes to saving the
					bay?</h3>
				<p>The bay is important to us for many reasons it’s a food
					source, a shipping source, and just an awesome place to visit and
					see nature.</p>
				<h3>How is it affecting your daily life?</h3>
				<p>Since our farm is on a tributary that feeds the Chesapeake we
					are strictly watched to not allow animals to wade in the water or
					drink out of the water.</p>
				<h3>Do you know which tributary? Or what body of water your
					farm directly flows into?</h3>
				<p>Antietam that flows into the Potomac</p>
				<h3>Have any recent policies negatively affected the way you
					run your farm or the amount you are able to produce?</h3>
				<p>We had to fence off a natural source of water because of the
					animals getting access to the river. That obviously has caused a
					higher use of our water pumps to supply water to them.</p>
				<h3>So, environmental best management practices, such as stream
					side fencing have had negative effects on your family’s overall
					production or costs?</h3>
				<p>It has made for higher cost which in farming when you’re
					fighting with pennies as it is any cost increase is tough</p>
				<h3>Are there any measurements you believe work best to both
					help the bay but also not dig deep into your family’s pockets?</h3>
				<p>If there was some access to the water that lead to our
					property yet kept the animals out of the direct water way would
					help I guess, something we could utilize without the burden of
					additional costs.</p>
				<h3>What challenges do you believe hinder the results of Bay
					restoration efforts the most?</h3>
				<p>I strongly believe that it is more destroyed by our everyday
					citizens who over mow their lawns, then spread pesticides and
					fertilizers weekly on their lawns, flowers, etc. Also, the over
					building of homes on natural land. The land can no longer absorb
					the natural rain water because of too many homes.</p>
				<h3>Are there any policies, regulations, or changes you see to
					be the most necessary for Chesapeake Bay cleanup?</h3>
				<p>Need to control over population and housing growth on farm
					land along with growth in our forest. Prime example is the floods
					in Ellicott City...if you look at what was natural land its now
					covered in houses which caused basically a canal effect right into
					the city.</p>
				<h3>So, you see urban development as one of the bigger
					contributors to problems for the bay?</h3>
				<p>Yes, and really to be clearer it’s the over development of
					the lands not just development in general</p>
				<h3>What is your understanding of the progress of the bay? Do
					you think it is improving, declining or staying the same?</h3>
				<p>My understanding is it is improving.</p>
				<h3>Why do you think that? What sources do you use?</h3>
				<p>Recent election adds focused on some major changes in and
					around the bay. I also know that waterways near me have looked
					clearer than they seemed to be 10-15 years ago.</p>
				<h3>Which policy do you think should be given priority when
					concerning the bay region, environmental protection or economic
					growth?</h3>
				<p>Controlling urban sprawl and over development of
					lands...there is plenty of older buildings or houses that sit
					vacant that could be used......also need to focus on the invasive
					fish like the catfish that humans placed there that are destroying
					our oyster bays</p>

				<h2 class="major">Scholar</h2>
				<span class="image main"><img src="images/BayTributary1.png"
					alt="" /></span>
				<h3>What are your biggest concerns when it comes to saving the
					bay? How is it affecting your daily life, if any?</h3>
				<p>From a personal perspective, the pollution in the bay makes
					it a wasted opportunity for recreational activities and will only
					worsen if something is not done. I also enjoy diversity in the
					animal and plant life within the region and would be disappointed
					should that be reduced. Unfortunately, I have little experience
					with the bay as a whole and local opinion makes me less
					enthusiastic to utilize it. As such, my daily life is mostly
					unaffected.</p>
				<h3>When considering new legislation, what factors do you
					consider or believe should be considered before pushing forward?</h3>
				<p>First and foremost, the health of the population surrounding
					the bay should be prioritized. Policies also need to consider the
					long-term effects and be based on solid scientific data. Policies
					regarding economic concerns should consider how any change could
					influence the region as a whole. Higher pollution could reduce
					property value and lower recreational-based businesses but too many
					restrictions could also limit economic growth and increase the
					prices of certain products (e.g. agricultural products).</p>
				<h3>When does scientific data related to Bay health and
					environmental protection take precedence over people's economic
					livelihood when making or advocating for policy decisions?</h3>
				<p>Similar to the responses above, scientific data related to
					the health of the population surrounding the bay should take the
					highest precedence. Likewise, any evidence that would indicate that
					pollution is approaching a threshold of nearly irreversible damage
					to any of the associated ecosystems should also be considered very
					strongly. Additionally, if the scientific data suggests that
					reasonable changes to current activities could improve their effect
					on the bay (e.g. alternative farming practices or the
					identification of critical contaminants) then the legislation
					should reflect that.</p>
				<h3>What challenges do you believe hinder the results of Bay
					restoration efforts the most?</h3>
				<p>Some of the major issues that I feel hinder the restoration
					efforts are: 1) the size of the population the utilizes the
					Chesapeake Bay and its watershed. 2) The number of different states
					that are connected to the watershed.</p>
				<p>The Chesapeake Bay itself is predominantly in MD but the
					greater watershed is spread to neighboring states. Notably,
					agricultural heavy states like PA likely contribute a lot to the
					pollution but convincing the state to pass legislation that would
					limit their own populace would be a hard sell. As such, it is
					likely hard to form proper legislation when it relies on
					cooperation from states displaced from the actual bay or action
					from the federal government.</p>
				<h3>Are there any policies, regulations, or changes you see to
					be the most necessary for Chesapeake Bay cleanup?</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Increasing the education of how actions influence the bay
						health</li>
					<li>Emphasizing to the public why this is important in their
						lives.</li>
					<li>Limitations should be placed regarding the development
						within the Chesapeake Bay watershed.</li>
					<li>Increase the publicity of current policies and
						initiatives.</li>
				</ol>
				<h3>What is your understanding of the progress of the bay? Do
					you think it is improving, declining or staying the same?</h3>
				<p>I have heard that there are goals to improve the quality of
					the Baltimore Inner Harbor, which I assume is also a goal for the
					neighboring regions as well. The fact that it is being discussed
					would suggest to me that there is an active effort underway, but
					the specifics of how this is to be done have not been as apparent.
					I have heard nothing about the policies from adjacent states.
					Overall, I would say that the quality could be increasing but there
					is much room for improvement.</p>
				<h3>Since you are a Vermont native, have you noticed any
					difference in the way Maryland handles environmental policy vs. how
					Vermont handles environmental concerns?</h3>
				<p>Oddly enough the city of Burlington, the only
					metropolitan-like area in VT, still dumps a lot of waste into the
					Lake Champlain and there are a lot of concerns with the sanitation
					issues that result from this. Overall, though, the area seems
					cleaner and several differences likely contribute to that. 1) The
					population and population densities are much lower (the state’s
					population is nearly identical to Baltimore City proper)– so the
					shear amount of waste is lower. 2) There is a lot of discussion at
					the public level with regards to being green and the city itself is
					completely powered by renewable energy. So, there is more knowledge
					of the concerns. 3) The population is aging and many of the
					residents are retirees that moved there for the reason to keep it
					green.</p>
				<p>As for initiatives in VT, there has been legislation put in
					place to lower the phosphorus levels that drain from agricultural
					work and a group even sued the EPA to lower the maximum allowed
					phosphorus run-off. With regards to other environmental concerns,
					VT has building restrictions to prevent changing much of the
					natural feel, but this may also be more doable as a result of a
					smaller population. There is also a law requiring mandatory
					composting for restaurants and individuals by 2020. In contrast,
					the Chesapeake Bay area includes a much higher population and
					includes a very large watershed and the initiatives are less
					apparent to me.</p>
